# React + Vite Template

This is a template available for cloning when i want to make a new React/Vite project. It has some configuration changes to make things run how I want with the linter among other things.

## How to clone
```npx tiged matchoomeelah/my-react-vite-template#main project-name```

## Running the application
Change directory to your new application directory
```cd project-name```

Install the dependencies
```npm install```


Run the app
```npm run dev```


## Customize
Make sure to change the ```title``` in index.html, and the ```name``` in package.json to reflect your app's details.

Make a new README.md eventually.
